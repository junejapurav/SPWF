                <p>Watch our Saturday activity where children express their creativity through glass painting. This week's theme is fish in a fish tank, and you'll be amazed at how these young artists bring the  underwater world to life with vibrant colors and imaginative designs. Join us in supporting their love for art and imagination.
This activity provides an opportunity for them to showcase their artistic abilities and learn new skills while having fun. Our NGO is committed to empowering and nurturing these children through various programs andÂ initiatives.</p>
